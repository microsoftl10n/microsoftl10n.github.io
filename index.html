   <h2>How points are calculated?</h2>
	<u>A scenario for Documentation</u>: Sandra is a contributor who submits a pull request with one suggestion. By default, she gets
15 points and if her suggestion <br>has been accepted after being reviewed, she will get 60 additional points for a total of 75 points.
<br><br>
Documentation points are calculated on the following criteria
<ul>
    <li>Documentation Point = Suggestion * 15 + Accepted Suggestion * 60</li>
    <li>One Suggestion = 15 points</li>
    <li>One Approved Suggestion = 60 points</li>
</ul>
<br>
	<u>A scenario for Software</u>: Jeff is a customer that reviews a machine translated sentence of 10 words, he makes edits accordingly and submits it. <br>
By default, he gets 20 points. If his translation gets voted and approved, he gets 80 additional points <br>
for a total of 100 points. He can also review someone's suggested words, vote for it and get additional 2 points.
<br><br>
Software points are calculated on the following criteria:
<ul>
    <li>Software Point = Suggestion word * 2 + Voted String * 2 + Accepted translation word * 8</li>
    <li>1 suggested word = 2 points</li>
    <li>1 approved word = 8 points</li>
    <li>Voting other users' translations = 2 points per vote</li>
</ul>
Note: we only show the contributors who earn 100 points or more in the leaderboard.
