<h2>The Leaderboard explained</h2>

<br><br>
<h2>How are points calculated?</h2>
  
<h3>Content Contribution (Microsoft Docs)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>15 points for each <i>PR Suggestion</i></li>
    <li>60 points for each <i>Approved PR Suggestion</i></li>
</ul>
NOTE: Suggestions are reviewed and approved/rejected by linguistic moderators.

<br><br>
   <u>Example</u>: A contributor submits a pull request with 4 suggestions. They receive 4 x 15 = 60 points. 
   If the suggestions are approved, then the contributor receives an additional 4 x 60 = 240 points.     
<br><br>

<h3>Software Contribution (Microsoft Localization Community Platform)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Each Translated Word is worth 2 points.</li>
    <li>Each Approved Translated Word is worth 8 points. (*A string of words is approved when it receives 2 or more votes from other contributors on MLCP.)</li>
    <li>Each Vote Given is worth 2 points. (<i>A Vote Given is when a contributor votes for a suggestion that isn't their own</i>)</li>
</ul>
<u>Example 1:</u> 
A contributor translates a string with 9 words. They will receive 9 x 2 = 18 points
This string is approved when it receives 2 or more votes from the community. The contributor receives an additional 9 x 8 = 72 points. 

<br><br>
<u>Example 2:</u> 
A contributor votes for 5 translated strings, that have all been translated by another contributor.  The contributor who has voted gets 5 x 2 = 10 points. 
<br><br>
<b>NOTE: we only show the contributors who earn 100 points or more in the leaderboard.</b>

Above all and in addition to their amazing technical abilities, MVPs are always willing to help others - that's what sets them apart.
