Hello. I am MVP Jae Yong Kum from South Korea.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.240
I have been active as a .NET developer MVP since 2012.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.130
MVPs from South Korea, China, and Japan participated in the three-way campaign

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:21.060
to improve the translation quality of Microsoft sites,

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.640
and South Korea won in both the team and individual areas.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.020
Winning is great, but I think above all that we were fortunate to have been able to make a contribution, albeit small, to improving the translation quality of

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.170
MS Docs documentation, in which all South Korean developers participated.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.910
Since before I became active as an MVP, every time I accessed a Microsoft product, there either was no Korean-language version available

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.480
or I would often think that the quality of the Korean-language translation was a little disappointing.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:01:01.420
Docs documentation in particular was at the level of machine translation,

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.680
and there were many parts that I could not understand when I tried to read them. However, with the opportunity of the recent event, MVPs and many other people came together

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.860
to create better quality documentation ourselves rather than complaining to Microsoft. We were able to increase the quality level of the Korean-language translation

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.530
and I hope that were able to raise the level of satisfaction and pride as well.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:29.060
It was amazing to have my translations reflected in Docs documentation and a photo of me

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.020
posted as a Docs contributor. I even bragged about it to my wife and children because I was so proud.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.280
Open source is becoming a focus of IT conversations, and everyone can participate in their areas of interest with tools such as GitHub becoming available, and it is truly fortunate that Microsoft is listening to a variety of voices.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:50.840


00:01:51.460 --> 00:02:00.040
Although an MSDN subscription and opportunities such as Global Summits are major benefits of being an active MVP,

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:08.880
I think that the opportunities to convert development tools into Korean or participate directly in the improvement of Docs documentation translation quality are other great benefits.

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.060
Finally, despite the fact that .NET is a wonderful

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:20.880
ecosystem, the South Korean .NET market is relatively poor compared to other countries and good quality documentation is lacking.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:28.260
If I

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.350
had just one small wish as a developer, it would be for the documentation to be helpful so that many people could easily master development skills. I hope that the .NET base in South Korea expands and the .NET market soon blossoms.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.550
Thank you.
