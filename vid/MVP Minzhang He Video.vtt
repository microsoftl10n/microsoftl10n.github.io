Hello everybody, my name is Minzhang He.

2
00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:06.143
I am a member of the Microsoft China MVP Club,

3
00:00:06.143 --> 00:00:09.149
and I placed first in the last MVP Competition.

4
00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:12.468
My dream is to be able to code every day,

5
00:00:12.468 --> 00:00:17.388
but I also love to enjoy good food and drink, particularly Sichuan hotpot and Coca-Cola.

6
00:00:17.388 --> 00:00:19.702
Reading is also one of my hobbies.

7
00:00:19.702 --> 00:00:24.454
Reading original works has helped me to expand my English vocabulary to over 10,000 words.

8
00:00:24.454 --> 00:00:28.283
I hope to increase my vocabulary to 30,000 words within three years.

9
00:00:29.061 --> 00:00:34.799
University graduates in China generally only have to pass the national Level 4 exams,

10
00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:37.410
giving them a vocabulary of 3,000 to 4,000 words,

11
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.394
but 4-year-old children in the US know as many as 5,000 words.

12
00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:47.153
The 2016 UPI survey found that most US adults have a vocabulary of more than 42,000 words.

13
00:00:47.153 --> 00:00:53.437
I think that this is the reason that uptake of Microsoft’s cool, cutting-edge technology is not very high in China.

14
00:00:54.679 --> 00:01:00.947
Participating in the Chinese localization of Microsoft documentation and products was very inspiring.

15
00:01:00.947 --> 00:01:03.466
Through your own efforts, you can

16
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:08.941
give more people the opportunity to come into contact with and use the world’s most awesome software products and technologies.

17
00:01:08.941 --> 00:01:18.606
You can give more people the chance to master powerful technologies like Azure, Xamarin, and .NET Core,

18
00:01:18.606 --> 00:01:21.217
achieve things of greater value,

19
00:01:22.007 --> 00:01:27.451
and enable more businesses and developers to free themselves from the limitations of .NET 2.0 and 3.0.

20
00:01:27.756 --> 00:01:32.978
Participating in the Chinese localization program has also enabled me to greatly improve my own ability to deal with English,

21
00:01:32.978 --> 00:01:37.707
particularly in terms of how fast I can process English sentences, my level of comprehension, and my feel for the language.

22
00:01:37.871 --> 00:01:44.925
If you want to participate in the Chinese localization program, you should ideally have access to powerful online dictionaries, online translation services, and search engines,

23
00:01:44.925 --> 00:01:48.765
because a lot of the vocabulary and translations will be things that you haven’t come across before.

24
00:01:48.996 --> 00:01:54.602
Microsoft documentation is in reality an open-source project that is constantly evolving,

25
00:01:54.602 --> 00:01:57.158
with new content added all the time.

26
00:01:57.158 --> 00:02:01.316
Participating in this process gives you the chance to find out about many technologies that you didn’t understand before.

27
00:02:01.316 --> 00:02:06.856
One example that made a strong impression on me was a particular phrase that I came across.

28
00:02:06.856 --> 00:02:13.609
The original phrase was something like “perform step into debugging between the customer side and the server side.”

29
00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:19.626
After searching around online, I ended up rewriting the phrase as “cross-device debugging.”

30
00:02:19.626 --> 00:02:22.249
It’s also very much true that the more documents you are involved with localizing,

31
00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:24.249
the deeper your understanding of the documentation becomes.

32
00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:29.402
You continually discover previous submissions, and you can also further improve and optimize them.

33
00:02:29.402 --> 00:02:31.102
It’s like writing code:

34
00:02:31.102 --> 00:02:34.766
the more you do it, the better you are able to spot problems in earlier code.

35
00:02:34.766 --> 00:02:38.325
It also deepens your understanding of English.

36
00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:43.839
Of course, if you want to improve your English significantly, you need to put in a lot of effort.

37
00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:49.676
If you participate in Chinese document localization, it’s best to only make changes to an individual page on each submission.

38
00:02:49.676 --> 00:02:58.201
On one occasion during the recent MVP Competition, I made 2,800 revisions to 300 pages in a single submission.

39
00:02:58.201 --> 00:03:01.667
The result was that my submission was not accepted, so this is something that you have to watch out for.

40
00:03:01.667 --> 00:03:05.748
If you are interested in taking part, I hope that you will join us

41
00:03:05.748 --> 00:03:09.007
and help to popularize Microsoft’s cool, cutting-edge products and technologies.

42
00:03:09.007 --> 00:03:10.115
Thank you.
