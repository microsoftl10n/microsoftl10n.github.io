I’m Microsoft MVP for Microsoft Azure, Takashi Takebayashi

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.610
I’d like to tell you a story about the community localization activity for the technical documentation today.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.350
The most important message I’d like to tell you here is

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.500
“Just try it”

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:27.340
Let me explain the situation where the current technical document localization is in.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:36.290
Firstly, documents have been released day by day that human translation cannot keep up with updating.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.450
Even though machine translation helps localization,

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:49.400
the quality of machine-translated Japanese is not good which may occasionally make Japanese developers confused.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.730
When to talk about degree of understanding of English by Japanese, as this graph shows,

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.200
there are certain amount of people who are fine communicating with English, with which the original English documents work well.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.280
However, majority of people still prefer to refer to Japanese documents,

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.390
and current quality of localized documents are too poor for those audience,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.960
which could be a blocking issue for us to reach to them.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.070
Based on current situation, my suggestion for better technical document localization

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.410
is that utilizing machine translation as an initial translation tool

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.980
to accommodate with rapid document updates,

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:36.040
while community and I create/submit Pull Request to suggest refinement.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.190
Machine translation learns better localization by Pull Request

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.240
Those 3rd and 4th steps

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.330
will work not only for better document quality

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.800
but also refine machine translation memory for further localization.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.840
Also, I’d like to emphasis the benefit that community members would enjoy through your localization contribution.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.680
The first one is that it’s very helpful activity for the developers who want to read technical documents in Japanese.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.060
The second one is also great

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:16.200
that this contribution is reflected in your Activity on GitHub as it is made by Pull Request and Commit submission.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:25.780
It is highly awesome for lots of developers who want to feed “Grass” on GitHub contributions.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.480
As a summary,

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.840
Let me repeat the most important message here

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.170
“Just try it”

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.920
Hope this helps facilitating your community activity going forward.

00:02:40.456 --> 00:02:42.676
Thank you for your attention
